2014-1-30: In EBSeq 1.3.3, the default setting of EBTest function will remove 
low expressed genes (genes whose 75th quantile of normalized counts is less 
than 10) before identifying DE genes. 
These two thresholds can be changed in EBTest function.
We found that low expressed genes are more easily to be affected by noises. 
Removing these genes prior to downstream analyses can improve the 
model fitting and reduce impacts of noisy genes (e.g. genes with outliers).

2014-5-22: In EBSeq 1.5.2, an extra numerical approximation step is 
implemented in EBTest() function to avoid
underflow. The underflow is likely due to large number of samples.

2014-6-5: In EBSeq 1.5.3, a bug is fixed. The bug may generate NA FC estimates when there are no replicates.

2014-9-4: In EBSeq 1.5.4, an extra numerical approximation step is implemented 
in EBMultiTest() function to avoid
underflow. The underflow is likely due to large number of samples.
A bug in EBMultiTest() is fixed. The bug will cause error when there is
exactly 1 gene/isoform that needs numerical approximation.
